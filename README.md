# Rubric

Yet another [1BRC](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) implementation in Rust.

Actually this is a "learning" take to a port of [this elegant solution in Go](https://gist.github.com/corlinp/176a97c58099bca36bcd5679e68f9708) by [Corlin Palmer](https://github.com/corlinp). Trying to implement the solution in other languages (I have [another one in Elixir](https://github.com/arhyth/brex)) in hope of understanding what makes it performant.
